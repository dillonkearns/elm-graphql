It contains all the information needed to make the request and decode\nthe response (you don't hand-code the decoders yourself, they are auto-generated\nfor you!).\n\n\n## Building `SelectionSet`s\n\nA `SelectionSet` in `dillonkearns/elm-graphql` represents a set of\nzero or more things which are either sub-`SelectionSet`s or leaf fields.\n\nFor example, `SelectionSet.empty` is the most basic `SelectionSet` you could build.\n\n    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)\n    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)\n\n    query : SelectionSet () RootQuery\n    query =\n        SelectionSet.empty\n\nYou can execute this query, but the result won't be very interesting!\n\nIn the StarWars API example in the [`examples`](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/tree/master/examples/src)\nfolder, there is a top-level query field called `hello`. So you could also\nbuild a valid query to get `hello`:\n\n    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)\n    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)\n    import StarWars.Query as Query\n\n    query : SelectionSet Response RootQuery\n    query =\n        Query.hello\n\nThis is the equivalent of this raw GraphQL query:\n\n    query {\n      hello\n    }\n\nIf we wanted to query for two top-level fields it's just as easy. Let's see how we would grab both the `hello` and `goodbye` fields like this:\n\n    query {\n      hello\n      goodbye\n    }\n\nThe only difference for combining two `SelectionSet`s is that you need to define which\nfunction we want to use to combine the two fields together into one piece of data.\nLet's just define our own function for now, called `welcomeMessage`.\n\n    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)\n    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)\n    import StarWars.Query\n\n    welcomeMessage : String -> String -> String\n    welcomeMessage hello today =\n        hello ++ \"\\nToday is \" ++ today\n\n    query : SelectionSet String RootQuery\n    query =\n        SelectionSet.map2 welcomeMessage\n            Query.hello\n            Query.today\n\n    {-\n       If you run this query you'll get something like:\n\n       Hello from GraphQL!\n       Today is Wednesday, December 5\n    -}\n\nGreat, we retrieved two fields! But often you don't want to combine the values\ninto a primitive, you just want to store the values in some data structure\nlike a record. So a very common pattern is to use record constructors as the\nconstructor function for `map2` (or `mapN`). Any function that takes the right number of arguments\n(of the right types, order matters) will work here.\n\nLet's define a type alias for a record called `Phrases`. When we define this\ntype alias, Elm creates a function called `Phrases` that will build up a record\nof that type. So we can use that function with `map2`!\n\n    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)\n    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)\n    import StarWars.Query\n\n    type alias Phrases =\n        { helloPhrase : String\n        , goodbyePhrase : String\n        }\n\n    hero : SelectionSet Phrases RootQuery\n    hero =\n        SelectionSet.map2 Phrases\n            Query.hello\n            Query.goodbye\n\nNote that if you changed the order of `Query.hello` and `Query.goodbye`,\nyou would end up with a record with values under the wrong name. Order matters\nwith record constructors!\n\n\n## Modularizing `SelectionSet`s\n\nSince both single fields and collections of fields are `SelectionSet`s in `dillonkearns/elm-graphql`,\nyou can easily pull in sub-`SelectionSet`s to your queries. Just treat it like you would a regular field.\n\nThis is analogous to using a [fragment in plain GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments).\nThis is a handy tool for modularizing your GraphQL queries.\n\nLet's say we want to query Github's GraphQL API like this:\n\n    {\n      repository(owner: \"dillonkearns\", name: \"elm-graphql\") {\n      nameWithOwner\n      ...timestamps\n      stargazers(first: 0) { totalCount }\n      }\n    }\n\n    fragment timestamps on Repository {\n      createdAt\n      updatedAt\n    }\n\n(You can try the above query for yourself by pasting the query into the [Github query explorer](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/)).\n\nWe could do the equivalent of the `timestamps` fragment with the `timestampsFragment`\nwe define below.\n\n    import Github.Object\n    import Github.Object.Repository as Repository\n    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)\n    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)\n    import Iso8601\n    import Time exposing (Posix)\n\n    type alias Repo =\n        { nameWithOwner : String\n        , timestamps : Timestamps\n        }\n\n    type alias Timestamps =\n        { createdAt : Posix\n        , updatedAt : Posix\n        }\n\n    repositorySelection : SelectionSet Repo Github.Object.Repository\n    repositorySelection =\n        SelectionSet.map2 Repo\n            Repository.nameWithOwner\n            timestampsFragment\n\n    timestampsFragment : SelectionSet Timestamps Github.Object.Repository\n    timestampsFragment =\n        SelectionSet.map2 Timestamps\n            (Repository.createdAt |> mapToDateTime)\n            (Repository.updatedAt |> mapToDateTime)\n\n    mapToDateTime : SelectionSet Github.Scalar.DateTime scope -> SelectionSet Posix scope\n    mapToDateTime =\n        SelectionSet.mapOrFail\n            (\\(Github.Scalar.DateTime value) ->\n                Iso8601.toTime value\n                    |> Result.mapError\n                        (\\_ ->\n                            \"Failed to parse \"\n                                ++ value\n                                ++ \" as Iso8601 DateTime.\"\n                        )\n            )\n\nNote that both individual GraphQL fields (like `Repository.nameWithOwner`), and\ncollections of fields (like our `timestampsFragment`) are just `SelectionSet`s.\nSo whether it's a single field or a pair of fields, we can pull it into our\nquery using the exact same syntax!\n\nModularizing your queries like this is a great idea. Dealing with these\nsub-`SelectionSet`s also allows the Elm compiler to give you more precise\nerror messages. Just be sure to add type annotations to all your `SelectionSet`s!\n\n\n## Mapping & Combining\n\nNote: If you run out of `mapN` functions for building up `SelectionSet`s,\nyou can use the pipeline\nwhich makes it easier to handle large objects, but produces\nlower quality type errors.\n\n@docs map\n\n@docs map2, map3, map4, map5, map6, map7, map8\n\n@docs withDefault\n\n\n## Pipelines\n\nAs an alternative to the `mapN` functions, you can build up\n`SelectionSet`s using the pipeline syntax. If you've used\nthe [`elm-json-decode-pipeline`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline/latest/)\npackage then this style will feel very familiar. The `map2` example in this page\nwould translate to this using the pipeline notation:\n\n    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet, with)\n    import StarWars.Object\n    import StarWars.Object.Human as Human\n\n    type alias Human =\n        { name : String\n        , id : String\n        }\n\n    hero : SelectionSet Hero StarWars.Object.Human\n    hero =\n        SelectionSet.succeed Human\n            |> with Human.name\n            |> with Human.id\n\nYou can see an end-to-end example using the pipeline syntax in the [`examples`](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/tree/master/examples/src)\nfolder.\n\n@docs with, hardcoded, succeed\n\n@docs empty\n\n\n## Types\n\nThese types are built for you by the code generated by the `@dillonkearns/elm-graphql` command line tool.\n\n@docs SelectionSet, FragmentSelectionSet\n\n\n## Result (`...OrFail`) Transformations\n\n**Warning** When you use these functions, you lose the guarantee that the\nserver response will decode successfully.\n\nThese helpers, though convenient, will cause your entire decoder to fail if\nit ever maps to an `Err` instead of an `Ok` `Result`.\n\nIf you're wondering why there are so many `Maybe`s in your generated code,\ntake a look at the\n[FAQ question \"Why are there so many Maybes in my responses?

It simply takes the value you pass into it\nand decodes into that value without looking at the GraphQL response (just like\n`Json.Decode.succeed`).\n\nSo instead of hardcoding a field like `hardcoded`, `SelectionSet.succeed` hardcodes\nan entire `SelectionSet`.
