{-| The auto-generated code from the `@dillonkearns/elm-graphql` CLI provides
functions that you can use to build up `SelectionSet`s for the GraphQL Objects,
Interfaces, and Unions in your GraphQL schema.

Note that in these examples, all of the modules that start with `StarWars.` or `Github.`
are generated by running the [`@dillonkearns/elm-graphql`](https://npmjs.com/package/@dillonkearns/elm-graphql)
command line tool.

There are lots more end-to-end examples in the
[`examples` ](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/tree/master/examples/src)
folder.

With `dillonkearns/elm-graphql`, a `SelectionSet` describes a set of fields to
retrieve. It contains all the information needed to make the request and decode
the response (you don't hand-code the decoders yourself, they are auto-generated
for you!).


## Building `SelectionSet`s

A `SelectionSet` in `dillonkearns/elm-graphql` represents a set of
zero or more things which are either sub-`SelectionSet`s or leaf fields.

For example, `SelectionSet.empty` is the most basic `SelectionSet` you could build.

    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)
    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)

    query : SelectionSet () RootQuery
    query =
        SelectionSet.empty

You can execute this query, but the result won't be very interesting!

In the StarWars API example in the [`examples`](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/tree/master/examples/src)
folder, there is a top-level query field called `hello`. So you could also
build a valid query to get `hello`:

    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)
    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)
    import StarWars.Query as Query

    query : SelectionSet Response RootQuery
    query =
        Query.hello

This is the equivalent of this raw GraphQL query:

    query {
      hello
    }

If we wanted to query for two top-level fields it's just as easy. Let's see how we would grab both the `hello` and `goodbye` fields like this:

    query {
      hello
      goodbye
    }

The only difference for combining two `SelectionSet`s is that you need to define which
function we want to use to combine the two fields together into one piece of data.
Let's just define our own function for now, called `welcomeMessage`.

    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)
    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)
    import StarWars.Query

    welcomeMessage : String -> String -> String
    welcomeMessage hello today =
        hello ++ "\nToday is " ++ today

    query : SelectionSet String RootQuery
    query =
        SelectionSet.map2 welcomeMessage
            Query.hello
            Query.today

    {-
       If you run this query you'll get something like:

       Hello from GraphQL!
       Today is Wednesday, December 5
    -}

Great, we retrieved two fields! But often you don't want to combine the values
into a primitive, you just want to store the values in some data structure
like a record. So a very common pattern is to use record constructors as the
constructor function for `map2` (or `mapN`). Any function that takes the right number of arguments
(of the right types, order matters) will work here.

Let's define a type alias for a record called `Phrases`. When we define this
type alias, Elm creates a function called `Phrases` that will build up a record
of that type. So we can use that function with `map2`!

    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)
    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)
    import StarWars.Query

    type alias Phrases =
        { helloPhrase : String
        , goodbyePhrase : String
        }

    hero : SelectionSet Phrases RootQuery
    hero =
        SelectionSet.map2 Phrases
            Query.hello
            Query.goodbye

Note that if you changed the order of `Query.hello` and `Query.goodbye`,
you would end up with a record with values under the wrong name. Order matters
with record constructors!


## Modularizing `SelectionSet`s

Since both single fields and collections of fields are `SelectionSet`s in `dillonkearns/elm-graphql`,
you can easily pull in sub-`SelectionSet`s to your queries. Just treat it like you would a regular field.

This is analogous to using a [fragment in plain GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments).
This is a handy tool for modularizing your GraphQL queries.

Let's say we want to query Github's GraphQL API like this:

    {
      repository(owner: "dillonkearns", name: "elm-graphql") {
      nameWithOwner
      ...timestamps
      stargazers(first: 0) { totalCount }
      }
    }

    fragment timestamps on Repository {
      createdAt
      updatedAt
    }

(You can try the above query for yourself by pasting the query into the [Github query explorer](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/)).

We could do the equivalent of the `timestamps` fragment with the `timestampsFragment`
we define below.

    import Github.Object
    import Github.Object.Repository as Repository
    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)
    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)
    import Iso8601
    import Time exposing (Posix)

    type alias Repo =
        { nameWithOwner : String
        , timestamps : Timestamps
        }

    type alias Timestamps =
        { createdAt : Posix
        , updatedAt : Posix
        }

    repositorySelection : SelectionSet Repo Github.Object.Repository
    repositorySelection =
        SelectionSet.map2 Repo
            Repository.nameWithOwner
            timestampsFragment

    timestampsFragment : SelectionSet Timestamps Github.Object.Repository
    timestampsFragment =
        SelectionSet.map2 Timestamps
            (Repository.createdAt |> mapToDateTime)
            (Repository.updatedAt |> mapToDateTime)

    mapToDateTime : SelectionSet Github.Scalar.DateTime scope -> SelectionSet Posix scope
    mapToDateTime =
        SelectionSet.mapOrFail
            (\(Github.Scalar.DateTime value) ->
                Iso8601.toTime value
                    |> Result.mapError
                        (\_ ->
                            "Failed to parse "
                                ++ value
                                ++ " as Iso8601 DateTime."
                        )
            )

Note that both individual GraphQL fields (like `Repository.nameWithOwner`), and
collections of fields (like our `timestampsFragment`) are just `SelectionSet`s.
So whether it's a single field or a pair of fields, we can pull it into our
query using the exact same syntax!

Modularizing your queries like this is a great idea. Dealing with these
sub-`SelectionSet`s also allows the Elm compiler to give you more precise
error messages. Just be sure to add type annotations to all your `SelectionSet`s!


## Mapping & Combining

Note: If you run out of `mapN` functions for building up `SelectionSet`s,
you can use the pipeline
which makes it easier to handle large objects, but produces
lower quality type errors.

@docs map

@docs map2, map3, map4, map5, map6, map7, map8

@docs withDefault


## Pipelines

As an alternative to the `mapN` functions, you can build up
`SelectionSet`s using the pipeline syntax. If you've used
the [`elm-json-decode-pipeline`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline/latest/)
package then this style will feel very familiar. The `map2` example in this page
would translate to this using the pipeline notation:

    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet, with)
    import StarWars.Object
    import StarWars.Object.Human as Human

    type alias Human =
        { name : String
        , id : String
        }

    hero : SelectionSet Hero StarWars.Object.Human
    hero =
        SelectionSet.succeed Human
            |> with Human.name
            |> with Human.id

You can see an end-to-end example using the pipeline syntax in the [`examples`](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/tree/master/examples/src)
folder.

@docs empty


## Types

These types are built for you by the code generated by the `@dillonkearns/elm-graphql` command line tool.

@docs SelectionSet, FragmentSelectionSet


## Result (`...OrFail`) Transformations

**Warning** When you use these functions, you lose the guarantee that the
server response will decode successfully.

These helpers, though convenient, will cause your entire decoder to fail if
it ever maps to an `Err` instead of an `Ok` `Result`.

If you're wondering why there are so many `Maybe`s in your generated code,
take a look at the
[FAQ question "Why are there so many Maybes in my responses? How do I reduce them?"](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/blob/master/FAQ.md#why-are-there-so-many-maybes-in-my-responses-how-do-i-reduce-them).

## Collections of SelectionSets

@docs list, dict, foldl

import Dict exposing (Dict)
import Graphql.RawField as RawField exposing (RawField)
import Json.Decode as Decode exposing (Decoder)


{-| SelectionSet type
-}
type SelectionSet decodesTo scope
    = SelectionSet (List RawField) (Decoder decodesTo)


{-| Maps the data coming back from the GraphQL endpoint. In this example,
`User.name` is a function that the `@dillonkearns/elm-graphql` CLI tool created which tells us
that the `name` field on a `User` object is a String according to your GraphQL
schema.

    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)
    import Graphql.SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)
    import StarWars.Query as Query

    query : SelectionSet String RootQuery
    query =
        Query.hello |> SelectionSet.map String.toUpper

You can also map to values of a different type. For example, if we
use a (`String -> Int`) map function, it will change the type of our `SelectionSet`
accordingly:

    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)
    import Graphql.SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)
    import StarWars.Query as Query

    query : SelectionSet Int RootQuery
    query =
        Query.hello |> SelectionSet.map String.length

`SelectionSet.map` is also helpful when using a record to wrap a type:

    import Graphql.Operation exposing (RootQuery)
    import Graphql.SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)
    import StarWars.Query as Query

    type alias Response =
        { hello : String }

    query : SelectionSet Response RootQuery
    query =
        SelectionSet.map Response Query.hello

Mapping is also handy when you are dealing with polymorphic GraphQL types
(Interfaces and Unions).

    import Graphql.SelectionSet as SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet)
    import StarWars.Object.Droid as Droid
    import StarWars.Object.Human as Human
    import StarWars.Union
    import StarWars.Union.CharacterUnion

    type HumanOrDroidDetails
        = HumanDetails (Maybe String)
        | DroidDetails (Maybe String)

    heroUnionSelection : SelectionSet HumanOrDroidDetails StarWars.Union.CharacterUnion
    heroUnionSelection =
        StarWars.Union.CharacterUnion.fragments
            { onHuman = SelectionSet.map HumanDetails Human.homePlanet
            , onDroid = SelectionSet.map DroidDetails Droid.primaryFunction
            }

{-| Most commonly `succeed` is used to start a pipeline. See the description
in the Pipeline section above for more.

There are other ways to use `succeed`. It simply takes the value you pass into it
and decodes into that value without looking at the GraphQL response (just like
`Json.Decode.succeed`).

So instead of hardcoding a field like `hardcoded`, `SelectionSet.succeed` hardcodes
an entire `SelectionSet`. This can be useful if you want hardcoded data based on
only the type when using a polymorphic type (Interface or Union).

{-| Combine several `SelectionSet`s into a single `SelectionSet`. The
`String`s are used as the `Dict` keys and the result of the `SelectionSet`s
will be the values in the `Dict`. Note that the `SelectionSet`s must first
be coerced into the same type if they are not already. Usually you'll just
want to use `map2` and other functions in that section of these docs.

{-| Effectively turns a field that is `[String]` => `[String!]`, or `[User]` =>

This will cause your _entire_ decoder to fail if any elements in the list for this
field comes back as null.
It's far better to fix your schema then to use this escape hatch!

Often GraphQL schemas will contain things like `[String]` (i.e. a nullable list
of nullable strings) when they really mean `[String!]!` (a non-nullable list of
non-nullable strings). You can chain together these nullable helpers if for some
reason you can't go in and fix this in the schema, for example:

    releases : SelectionSet (List Release) Github.Object.ReleaseConnection

        Github.Object.ReleaseConnection.nodes release
            |> Field.nonNullOrFail
            |> Field.nonNullElementsOrFail

Without the `Field.nonNull...` transformations here, the type would be
`SelectionSet (Maybe (List (Maybe Release))) Github.Object.ReleaseConnection`.
